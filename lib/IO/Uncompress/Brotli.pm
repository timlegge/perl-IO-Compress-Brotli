=head1 NAME

IO::Uncompress::Brotli - Read Brotli buffers/streams

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IO::Uncompress::Brotli;

  # uncompress a buffer (yielding at most 10MB)
  my $decoded = unbro $encoded, 10_000_000;

  # uncompress a stream
  my $bro = IO::Uncompress::Brotli->create;
  while(have_input()) {
     my $block = get_input_block();
     my $decoded_block = $bro->decompress($block);
     handle_output_block($decoded_block);
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

IO::Uncompress::Brotli is a module that decompresses Brotli buffers
and streams. Despite its name, it is not a subclass of
L<IO::Uncompress::Base> and does not implement its interface. This
will be rectified in a future release.

=head2 One-shot interface

If you have the whole buffer in a Perl scalar use the B<unbro>
function.

=over

=item B<unbro>(I<$input>, I<$maximum_decoded_size>)

Takes a whole compressed buffer as input and returns the decompressed
data. It allocates a buffer of size I<$maximum_decoded_size> to store
the decompressed data, if this is not sufficient (or there is another
error) this function will croak.

As of version 0.004_002, the I<$maximum_decoded_size> argument is
optional. If not provided, B<unbro> uses the streaming interface
described in the next section to decompress the buffer in blocks of
one megabyte. The decompressed blocks are concatenated and returned.

Exported by default.

=head2 Streaming interface

If you want to process the data in blocks use the object oriented
interface. The available methods are:

=over

=item IO::Uncompress::Brotli->B<create>

Returns a IO::Uncompress::Brotli instance. Please note that a single
instance cannot be used to decompress multiple streams.

=item $bro->B<decompress>(I<$block>)

Takes the a block of compressed data and returns a block of
uncompressed data. Dies on error.
